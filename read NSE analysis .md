# NSE-analysis
IN THIS ANALYSIS I HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA OF STOCK PRICES OF PREVIOUS 10 YEARS PROVIDED BY NSE.
BY THIS ANALYSIS I CAME TO THE INTERPRETATION THAT THE STOCK OF TCS HAS PERFORMED GOOD OVER THE YEARS AND HAS A GOOD ROI.
WHEREAS STOCK PRICE OF WIPRO HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST 10 YEARS
AND STOCK PRICE OF INFOSYS HAS NOT SEEN MUCH VOLATILITY SINCE THE PAST 10 YEARS.
